# Music Recommendation System ðŸŽµ

A machine learning project that recommends music tracks to users based on their preferences and listening history. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, this project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and recommendation algorithms on a real-world music dataset.

## Overview

This project implements a music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to suggest songs to users that they are likely to enjoy, based on patterns in their listening behavior and song features.

The core logic is implemented in [Music_recommendation_system.ipynb](Music_recommendation_system.ipynb).

---

## Dataset

- **File:** `compressed_data.csv.gz`
- The dataset contains information about songs and user interactions.
- It is preprocessed and used for training and testing the recommendation models.

---

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Implementation of recommendation algorithms (e.g., content-based, collaborative filtering)
- Evaluation of recommendation performance

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset is loaded and preprocessed for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Insights about the data are generated through visualizations and statistics.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are extracted or created to improve recommendations.
4. **Modeling:** Recommendation algorithms are applied to suggest music tracks.
5. **Evaluation:** The system's performance is measured using appropriate metrics.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
  git clone https://github.com/AyushChauhan910/ML_Project---Music_Recommendation_System.git
  cd ML_Project---Music_Recommendation_System


2. **Install dependencies:**
- Make sure you have Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook installed.
- Install required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib):
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  *(Create a `requirements.txt` if not present.)*

3. **Run the notebook:**
  jupyter notebook Music_recommendation_system.ipynb

- Follow the notebook cells to see the data processing, modeling, and results.
